            <p>Hi Leo,</p>
            <p>Iâ€™ve been holding onto this for a while, and I think itâ€™s time to let it out. Iâ€™ve liked you since last year, ever since someone pointed out how we had a lot of similarities. That thought stayed with me, and it made me more curious about you.</p>
            <p>Since then, Iâ€™ve admired so much about you. Youâ€™re incredibly talented, whether itâ€™s in arts, academics, or just the way you approach everything with so much confidence and skill. The way you carry yourself and excel at so many things is amazing, and itâ€™s something I really look up to.</p>
            <p>Thereâ€™s also this moment that I still think about. Remember when we both came up to the stage to answer that trivia question? I felt really bad when you left because I shouldâ€™ve let you take that. Iâ€™m sorry for not stepping aside when I shouldâ€™ve. Itâ€™s a small thing, but itâ€™s stuck with me.</p>
            <p>I also want to apologize if Iâ€™ve ever made you uncomfortable when Iâ€™m around. That was never my intention. I just wanted to be honest about how I feel because itâ€™s been on my mind for a long time.</p>
            <p>No matter what your response is, I really respect you. I think youâ€™re an incredible person.</p>
            <p>Thank you for reading this. It means a lot to me.</p>
