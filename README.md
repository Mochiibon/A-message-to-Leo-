# A Message for Leo ðŸ’Œ

Hi Leo,

Iâ€™ve been holding onto this for a while, and I think itâ€™s time to let it out. Iâ€™ve liked you since last year, ever since someone pointed out how we had a lot of similarities. That thought stayed with me, and it made me more curious about you. During DSPC, when people even mistook me for you, it honestly made me notice you even more.

Since then, Iâ€™ve admired so much about you. Youâ€™re incredibly talented, whether itâ€™s in arts, academics, or just the way you approach everything with so much confidence and skill. The way you carry yourself and excel at so many things is amazing, and itâ€™s something I really look up to.

Thereâ€™s also this moment that I still think about. Remember when we both came up to the stage to answer that trivia question? I felt really bad when you left because I shouldâ€™ve let you take that. Iâ€™m sorry for not stepping aside when I shouldâ€™ve. Itâ€™s a small thing, but itâ€™s stuck with me.

I also want to apologize if Iâ€™ve ever made you uncomfortable when Iâ€™m around. That was never my intention. I just wanted to be honest about how I feel because itâ€™s been on my mind for a long time.

No matter what your response is, I really respect you. I think youâ€™re an incredible person.

Thank you for reading this. It means a lot to me.

Sincerely,
